# DarkWing

This is my first chrome extension app. It converts pages into dark mode with a toggle switch and even keeps media items such as thumbnails and images in their original format. It was mostly made in vanilla JS but I also used jQuery, bootstrap.

## Setup

- Download project onto a directory
- On your chrome broswer, enable developer tools in extensions
- Load unpacked from the project directory


## Notes and bug fixes to work on

- Work on best practises for dark mode. There are many things to consider as outlined in [this article](https://www.dyspatch.io/blog/the-danger-of-dark-mode-and-email/)
- For some websites, toggling back off doesn't go back to it's original state
- Instead of going pure black, consider using shades of grayscale. This ties into more research on best practices for dark mode from a UI standpoint.
